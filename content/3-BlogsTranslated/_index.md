This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 - Python 3.13 runtime is now available in AWS Lambda](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog announces the availability of Python 3.13 as a managed runtime and container base image in AWS Lambda. You will learn about the new features in Python 3.13 including data model improvements, typing changes with PEP 702 and PEP 696, and standard library enhancements. The article explains the transition to Amazon Linux 2023, important changes for container deployments, and performance considerations for the new runtime. It also covers unavailable experimental features like free-threaded CPython and JIT compiler, and provides practical guidance on how to start using Python 3.13 in Lambda through the AWS Management Console and container images.

###  [Blog 2 - Implementing custom domain names for private endpoints with Amazon API Gateway](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces the new support for custom domain names with private REST API endpoints in Amazon API Gateway. You will learn how to use simple and intuitive custom domain names instead of complex default URLs for your private APIs that are only accessible within your Amazon VPC. The article explains the distinction between frontend and backend integrations, connectivity types (public internet vs private VPC), and provides three different options for clients to connect to private REST API endpoints depending on VPC endpoint configuration. It also demonstrates how to share custom domain names across AWS accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) and includes practical configuration examples.

###  [Blog 3 - Accelerating data science innovation: How Bayer Crop Science uses AWS AI/ML services](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog presents how Bayer Crop Science leverages AWS AI/ML services to build their next-generation MLOps platform called Decision Science Ecosystem (DSE). You will learn how the company addresses the challenge of scaling genomic prediction models and managing large-scale data science operations to support regenerative agriculture. The article details their implementation of automated code documentation using Amazon Q, Lambda functions, and API Gateway, which reduces developer onboarding time by up to 70% and improves productivity by up to 30%. It also covers their integration with Amazon SageMaker for model training, the use of AWS Batch and EventBridge for documentation quality improvement, and how this solution supports their mission to increase crop yields by 50% by 2050 while restoring the environment.
