# Building a Serverless REST API with AWS Lambda and API Gateway

#### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a serverless REST API using **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon API Gateway**. This architecture allows you to create scalable, cost-effective APIs without managing servers.

You will build a simple **Task Management API** that allows users to:
- Create new tasks
- List all tasks
- Get a specific task
- Update a task
- Delete a task

The API will use:
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless compute functions
- **Amazon API Gateway** for REST API endpoints
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for data storage
- **AWS IAM** for security and permissions

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Create Lambda functions using Python
- Set up API Gateway REST API
- Integrate Lambda with API Gateway
- Store and retrieve data from DynamoDB
- Understand serverless architecture patterns
- Handle API errors and responses properly

#### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of REST API concepts
- AWS CLI configured (optional but recommended)
