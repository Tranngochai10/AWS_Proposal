### Week 5 Achievements:

Successfully completed all Week 5 objectives with strong mastery of:

- **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS secures the cloud, customers secure in the cloud. Responsibility varies by service type (Infrastructure → Container → Abstracted services).
- **Root Account Protection**: MFA enabled, never used for daily tasks, credentials safely stored, IAM Administrator users created instead.
- **AWS IAM Mastery**:
  - Principals: Root, IAM Users, IAM Roles, Federated Users, AWS Services
  - Policy types and evaluation: Explicit Deny wins, then Allow, then default Deny
  - IAM Roles + Trust Policy + STS for temporary, least-privilege, cross-account access
  - Cross-account delegation and service-linked roles
- **AWS Organizations**:
  - Centralized multi-account management with OUs
  - Service Control Policies (SCP) to set permission guardrails
  - Consolidated Billing
- **AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)**:
  - Identity source integration (built-in, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AD Connector, external IdP)
  - Permission Sets → auto-provisioned IAM Roles in member accounts
- **Amazon Cognito**:
  - User Pools for user sign-up/sign-in
  - Identity Pools for temporary AWS credential issuance
- **AWS KMS**:
  - Customer Managed Keys (CMK), FIPS 140-2 compliant
  - Data Key pattern for large-scale encryption
- **AWS Security Hub**:
  - Continuous security checking against AWS Foundational Best Practices, CIS, PCI DSS, etc.
  - Security score and prioritized findings

Hands-on completed:
- Built full AWS Organizations structure with SCPs
- Configured AWS Identity Center with Permission Sets
- Implemented Cognito authentication flow
- Encrypted resources with KMS
- Activated and analyzed Security Hub findings
