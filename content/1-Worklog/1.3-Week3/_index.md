### Week 3 Achievements:

Successfully completed 100% of the planned tasks with the following key takeaways:

- Deep understanding of **Amazon EC2** as scalable virtual servers that can fully replace physical servers for almost any workload (web hosting, applications, databases, authentication, etc.).
- Mastered hardware configuration via **Instance Types** (CPU, memory, network, storage) and related concepts: Hypervisor (Nitro/KVM/HVM/PV), Placement Groups, and Availability Zones.
- Clear grasp of **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: contains root volume, launch permissions + block device mapping; can use AWS-provided, Marketplace, or custom AMIs; backup via AMI creation or EBS snapshots.
- Proficient with **Key Pairs**: SSH authentication for Linux and encrypted Administrator password decryption for Windows instances.
- Thorough knowledge of **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**:
  - Persistent block storage independent of EC2 lifecycle, connected via private EBS network within the same AZ
  - SSD & HDD families, 99.99% availability via replication across multiple nodes
  - Multi-Attach capability on Nitro-based instances
  - Backup via incremental snapshots stored in S3
- Understood **Instance Store**: high-performance ephemeral NVMe storage physically attached to the host; data lost on Stop (but preserved on Reboot); ideal for cache, buffer, swap, temporary data.
- Learned **User Data** scripts (Bash/PowerShell) and **Instance Metadata** for automation and self-configuration.
- Explored EC2 pricing models and Auto Scaling:
  - On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances
  - Auto Scaling Groups support multiple pricing models, multi-AZ operation, and automatic registration with Elastic Load Balancers
- Studied complementary services:
  - **Amazon Lightsail**: low-cost, simplified VPS with bundled data transfer, ideal for dev/test and light workloads
  - **EFS (Elastic File System)**: fully managed NFS for Linux, pay-for-use storage, supports on-premises access via DX/VPN
  - **FSx**: managed Windows File Server (SMB) and FSx for Lustre, with built-in deduplication (30–50% savings)
  - **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**: continuous replication for lift-and-shift migration and DR from on-premises/physical/virtual servers to AWS
- Hands-on success: launched EC2 instances, connected via SSH/RDP, attached EBS volumes, created snapshots and custom AMIs.
