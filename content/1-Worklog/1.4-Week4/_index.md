### Week 4 Achievements:

Successfully completed all Week 4 objectives with the following key learnings:

- Mastered **Amazon S3** fundamentals:
  - Object storage (not block/file), write-once-read-many (WORM) model, unlimited total capacity, max 5 TB per object
  - Designed for 99.999999999% (11×9s) durability and 99.99% availability
  - Data automatically replicated across minimum 3 Availability Zones in a region
  - Supports multipart upload, event notifications, static website hosting, and CORS configuration

- Understood **S3 Storage Classes** and cost optimization:
  - S3 Standard, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive
  - Lifecycle policies to automatically transition or expire objects

- Security & access control:
  - S3 Bucket Policies, IAM Policies, S3 Access Control Lists (legacy), S3 Access Points
  - Block Public Access, VPC Endpoints for private connectivity

- Advanced features:
  - Versioning (protects against accidental deletion/overwrites and ransomware)
  - Cross-Region Replication (CRR) & Same-Region Replication (SRR)
  - S3 performance optimization using random prefixes to distribute objects across partitions

- Deep understanding of **Amazon S3 Glacier**:
  - Low-cost archival storage with three retrieval options:
    - Expedited (1–5 min)
    - Standard (3–5 hours)
    - Bulk (5–12 hours)

- Learned **AWS Snow Family** for large-scale data migration:
  - Snowball (80 TB), Snowball Edge (100 TB + compute), Snowmobile (up to 100 PB per truck)

- Mastered **AWS Storage Gateway** – hybrid storage:
  - File Gateway → S3 (NFS/SMB)
  - Volume Gateway → S3 (iSCSI, cached or stored mode, snapshot to EBS)
  - Tape Gateway → Virtual Tape Library (S3/Glacier)

- Disaster Recovery concepts:
  - RTO (Recovery Time Objective) – maximum acceptable downtime
  - RPO (Recovery Point Objective) – maximum acceptable data loss
  - Four AWS DR strategies: Backup & Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, Multi-Site Active/Active
  - AWS Backup – centralized backup management across EBS, EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, Storage Gateway

Hands-on practice completed:
- Created S3 buckets with versioning, lifecycle policies, static website hosting
- Configured bucket policies, CORS, and VPC endpoints
- Tested multipart upload and event triggers
- Explored AWS Backup console and created backup plans
