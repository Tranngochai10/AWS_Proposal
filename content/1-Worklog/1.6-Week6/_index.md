### Week 6 Achievements:

Successfully completed all Week 6 objectives with strong mastery of:

- Core database concepts: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Index, Partitioning, Execution Plan, Buffer Pool, Transaction Log, Session
- Clear differentiation between:
  - RDBMS (relational, SQL, ACID) vs NoSQL (flexible schema, eventual consistency)
  - OLTP (fast transactions, row-based) vs OLAP (complex analytics, columnar, historical data)

- **Amazon RDS**:
  - Fully managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora)
  - Automated backups, Read Replicas, Multi-AZ failover, storage autoscaling, encryption at rest & in transit

- **Amazon Aurora**:
  - Cloud-native relational database with MySQL & PostgreSQL compatibility
  - Revolutionary storage layer for high concurrent read/write performance
  - Unique features: Backtrack, Aurora Clones, Global Database, Multi-Master

- **Amazon Redshift**:
  - Fully managed petabyte-scale data warehouse optimized for OLAP
  - MPP architecture + columnar storage
  - Leader + Compute nodes, Redshift Spectrum, concurrency scaling

- **Amazon ElastiCache**:
  - Managed Redis & Memcached
  - Automatic failure detection and replacement
  - Used as caching layer in front of databases to offload read-heavy OLTP workloads
  - Redis preferred for new applications

Hands-on completed:
- Deployed RDS Multi-AZ + Read Replica
- Created Aurora cluster with Global Database
- Built Redshift cluster and ran analytical queries
- Deployed ElastiCache Redis and integrated with sample app
